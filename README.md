## Instructions
* How to play the matching memory Game?
To play the memory game or matching game you have pairs of icons you should make each pair matches each other, you can do that by clicking the first card then click the second card if they are the same icon they will still be opening in front of you on your screen

Notice that their color will change from blue to **green** that means that they are _matching_ the same icon

* But what happens if they are not matching with the same Icon?
```
if they are not matching they will flip back again and they will not turn to green that means that they doesn't match
```
Keep trying to get the two matching cards with the same Icon
after matching the first pairs and by the way to achieve the last pair the color for every matching pair will turn to green

* You should make it fast to get the **best rating** you will see it in **stars**

* you will see your **time** in playing, **rating** and your count of **moves**

enjoy :D
